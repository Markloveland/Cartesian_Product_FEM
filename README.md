# Cartesian_Product_FEM

Action Balance folder contains numerical tests designed to test the numerics in the Action Balance Equation

Numerical_Tests folder contains ipynb that were used to run numerical tests in the paper, these can be run with any recent FEniCS installation.
I would reccommend either installation through docker https://fenics.readthedocs.io/projects/containers/en/latest/jupyter.html or via conda https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/fenics

The version used for these particular tests was the installation via docker which is version 2019.1.0
